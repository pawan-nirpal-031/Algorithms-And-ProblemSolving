/*
Problem Statement : 

Polycarp likes arithmetic progressions. A sequence [a1,a2,…,an] is called an arithmetic progression if for each i (1≤i<n) the value ai+1−ai is the same. For example, the sequences [42], [5,5,5], [2,11,20,29] and [3,2,1,0] are arithmetic progressions, but [1,0,1], [1,3,9] and [2,3,1] are not.

It follows from the definition that any sequence of length one or two is an arithmetic progression.

Polycarp found some sequence of positive integers [b1,b2,…,bn]. He agrees to change each element by at most one. In the other words, for each element there are exactly three options: an element can be decreased by 1, an element can be increased by 1, an element can be left unchanged.

Determine a minimum possible number of elements in b which can be changed (by exactly one), so that the sequence b becomes an arithmetic progression, or report that it is impossible.

It is possible that the resulting sequence contains element equals 0.
