/*
Problem Statement : 

Chefland is a 1D city where each of the N houses is located at a distinct positive integer coordinate A1,A2,â€¦AN. The chef is planning to create K hills in the city. Note that two hills cannot be present at the same location but the location of hills and houses can overlap and each hill will also be at any integer (positive, negative or zero) coordinate.

Each citizen would want to travel to the farthest hill from his house. Travelling will create air pollution and Chef wants to minimise the total pollution in the city. Help Chef find the minimum sum of distance travelled by everyone. In other words, help Chef create the hills at optimal locations, so that the sum of the distance of every house to the hill farthest from it is minimum possible.
