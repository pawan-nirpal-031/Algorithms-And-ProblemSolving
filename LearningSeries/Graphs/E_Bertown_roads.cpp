/*
Problem Statement : 

Bertown has n junctions and m bidirectional roads. We know that one can get from any junction to any other one by the existing roads.

As there were more and more cars in the city, traffic jams started to pose real problems. To deal with them the government decided to make the traffic one-directional on all the roads, thus easing down the traffic. Your task is to determine whether there is a way to make the traffic one-directional so that there still is the possibility to get from any junction to any other one. If the answer is positive, you should also find one of the possible ways to orient the roads.
