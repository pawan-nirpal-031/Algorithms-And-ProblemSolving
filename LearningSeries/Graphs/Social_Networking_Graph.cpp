/*
In a social networking site, people are connected with other people. The whole system appears as a giant 
connected graph. In this question, you are required to answer the total number of people connected at t nodes 
away from each other (t distance connectivity). For example: Two persons directly connected are at 1 distance 
connectivity. While the two persons having a common contact without having direct connectivity, are at 2 distance 
connectivity. First line of input line contains, two integers n and e, where n is the nodes and e are the edges. 
Next e line will contain two integers u and v meaning that node u and node v are connected to each other in 
undirected fashion. Next line contains single integer, m, which is number of queries. Next m lines, each have 
two inputs, one as source node and other as a required t distance connectivity which should be used to process 
query.
